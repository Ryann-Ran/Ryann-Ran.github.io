<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Yuran Wang, currently a Master's student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University. From 2022 to 2025, I conducted research on multimodal learning under the guidance of [Prof. Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/) at AIM Lab, Wuhan University. Since 2024, I have been with DCAI Lab, focusing on unified understanding and generation, supervised by [Prof. Wentao Zhang](https://zwt233.github.io/) at Peking University.

My research interests include *multimodal large language models* and *computer vision*. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration!
